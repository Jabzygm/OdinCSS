    <h3>Mtsvadi is traditional Georgian barbeque, very juicy and delicious. Georgia’s Kakheti region is especially famous <br> for preparing most delicious barbeque in whole country. 
    Georgian barbeque can be made from pork and veal <br> as well, yet pork mtsvadi is more popular. If you prepare mtsvadi with this kind of marinade,
    you will end up <br> eating most tender and juicy barbeque ever.</h3>
    <h2>WHAT THE HELL IS A KEBAB RAAAAAAAAAH</h2>
    <h1>SECRET TO GOOD MTSVADI</h1>
    <p><b> <i>Nowadays, in nearly every region of Georgia, different kinds of Mtsvadi are served, with some made using wine, lemon, <br> vinegar, herbs, green peppers, or various kinds of vegetables,
    or smothered in pomegranate juice. Others are marinated in beer <br> or softened in milk or matsoni. In Georgia, people also love Mtsvadi made from fish, veal, beef, chicken, mushrooms, <br>
    and shrimp, but pork remains the gold standard.
    <br> <br>
    For making a good Mtsvadi, in-depth knowledge of meat is crucial. For instance, shoulder meat dries easily and grills quickly <br> on the embers, so it is not recommended to mix it with
    any other cuts of meat. Meanwhile, the embers for Mtsvadi <br> should not be red-hot. Rather, the grilling should only start once the embers have cooled a little and started to turn white.
    <br>The Mtsvadi should take 20 to 25 minutes to cook at the right temperature, although bear in mind that it cooks faster <br> in summer than in winter. If the meat is very fatty,
    then it is more likely to catch on fire. If that happens, <br> rather than splashing water on it, instead use salt, wine, or pomegranate juice, which will put that particular <br> fire out while
    maintaining the required temperature. <br> <br>
    Usually, real Kakhetian Mtsvadi should not be left unattended and should be turned over often, so that it cooks evenly.</i></b></p>
